# Welcome to Suva's GitHub Account!

This GitHub account is dedicated to providing key technical resources for interacting with Suva through our Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

Our repositories contain details about these APIs, provide access to important artifacts, and deliver insights on how to best use the interfaces we offer.

Please note, the use of interfaces in this repository requires an insurance policy with Suva. For anonymously accessible interfaces, please refer to our
documentation at https://www.suva.ch/de-ch/unfall/fuer-leistungserbringer/informationen/api-information-fuer-softwareentwickler.
